                <br>I do not own the icons, and they come from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com">flaticon</a>
                <br>I took the photos from Flickr API, and the videos from Youtube, and obviously they belong to their uploaders.</p>
                <p><h3>MOTIVATION</h3></p>
                <p><a href="http://www.airbnb.com">Airbnb</a> doesn't have a public API (yet). It's the only complain I have about this wonderful service. I found my two last homes through Airbnb. I had the idea to 'build an unofficial API' for myself actually, since I started to look for my new dream apartment in London.

                <p><h3>ABOUT MESTO.IO</h3></p>
                <p><i>Mesto</i> means city in Slovenian. It sounded nice to me, and the domain name was free, so...
                <br>Mesto.io is a little tool that sorts the apartment by price, rating and reviews, which is useful to find out which one would be perfect for you.
                <br>I used AngularJS, LESS, MomentJS, Bootstrap and Parse.
                </p>
